PackRaft
========

    Copyright 2023 by Larry Hastings

    A gloriously simple serialization library for RPC messages.

Quickstart
==========

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    import packraft
    import socket

    @dataclass # important!
    class MyMessage(packraft.Message):
        message: str
        request_id: int

    r, w = socket.socketpair()
    msg = MyMessage("Hello, networked chum", 33)
    msg.send(w)

    msg2 = packraft.Message.recv(r)
    assert msg2 == msg


Overview
========

    PackRaft is a serialization library for networked
    messages.  It allows you to seamlessly serialize a
    Python object and send it over a socket (or store
    it in a file, etc), then deserialize it and recreate
    an identical object.

    Unlike pickle, PackRaft doesn't sidestep normal
    object creation, and it doesn't root around in your
    modules to find your classes.  Instead, there's
    an automatic (but explicit) registration mechanism
    for classes that can be serialized and unserialized.

    Note that PackRaft requires the serializer and
    deserializer to have *identical* registered classes.

    The actual serialization is done using MessagePack.
    PackRaft first serializes your object into a
    MessagePack-supported object, usually a dict. This is
    called "packing" the object.  PackRaft then serializes
    that object using MessagePack, prefixes the resulting
    bytes object with metadata (protocol id, length)
    so it can be correctly read on the receiving side,
    and writes it to the file-like object.

    On the receiving side, once PackRaft has received
    a complete message, it unserializes the bytes object
    with MessagePack, then "unpacks" that object using
    the various PackRaft-registered classes, and finally
    returns the recreated object to you.

    PackRaft 1.0 doesn't try very hard to reduce the
    size of its messages.  It's really just a toy,
    written for use in David Beazley's "Rafting Trip"
    class.

Using PackRaft
==============

    There are just a couple of rules.

    * All the objects you serialize should either be
      supported directly by MessagePack, or should be
      subclasses of a class that inherits from
      packraft.Packable, or serialized with a
      packraft.Packer class.
        * Every class that inherits from either
          packraft.Packable or packraft.Packer must
          have a globally unique name.
    * Most of your high-level messages should be subclasses
      of packraft.Message, which handles packing and
      unpacking for you.  *Every* subclass of
      packraft.Message *must* be decorated with @dataclass,
      and every attribute defined on the subclass should
      have an annotation with the type of the value.
      Annotations should be either
        * one of the types natively supported by
          MessagePack:
            * None
            * bool
            * int
            * float
            * str
            * bytes
            * dict
        * a subclass of Packable,
        * a type registered as being handled by a Packer,
        * or list[X] or tuple[X] where X is one of
          the previous three options.
    * If you don't want to use @dataclass, you should instead
      subclass packraft.Packable.  You'll have to implement
      your own pack() and unpack() methods.
    * If you want to add support for packing and unpacking
      a third-party type, you can do that by creating a
      subclass of packraft.Packer with custom pack() and
      unpack() methods, and registering it as a handler for
      that third-party type with the @packraft.packs() decorator.
    * Most of the time, you should send a message by
      calling its "send" method, and you should receive
      messages by calling the packraft.Message class
      method "recv". Both take a file-like object
      (e.g. a socket), both are blocking.

#
# The PackRaft wire format
# ------------------------
#
# Let's say we want to send an object o, which represents a message,
# using the PackRaft wire format.  We proceed as follows:
#
# First, we need a "protocol".   This is a bytes string that will
#    appear at the beginning of *every* message.  We'll call our
#    bytes string PROTOCOL.
#
#    The protocol string should be at least four bytes, though really
#    anything will work.  If PackRaft gets a message that doesn't
#    start with the correct protocol, it throws an exception,
#    which will probably (hopefully!) stop processing.
#
# Next we serialize o using MessagePack, let's call the resulting bytes object B.
#    If o doesn't serialize properly, MessagePack will throw an exception.
#    (The rest of this file handles converting Python objects into
#    MessagePack-friendly equivalents, a process called "packing".)
#
# At last we're ready to build our wire format message.  There are actually
# two different formats; one is used for small messages, the other for larger
# messages.
#
# If len(B) <= 127, the wire format for this message is
#    PROTOCOL
#    len(B) (a single unsigned byte)
#    B
# and the total length of the message is len(PROTOCOL) + 1 + len(B).
#
# If len(B) >= 128, then:
#    We serialize len(B) using MessagePack, let's call the resulting bytes object L.
#    The wire format for this message is
#        PROTOCOL
#        len(L) | 0x80 (a single unsigned byte),
#        L
#        B
# and the total length of the message is len(PROTOCOL) + 1 + len(L) + len(B).
#
# I regret to inform you that this protocol has a maximum message
# length of

# (That's 256**127 bytes.)

# If you attempt to encode a message that's too large,
